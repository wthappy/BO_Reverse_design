# BO_Reverse_design
Bayesian reverse design based on experimental knowledge constraints.This work takes MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells as an example.

In the Bayesian optimization process, the initial scatter points have a certain degree of randomness (which cannot be fixed by random seeds), so different optimal parameter values may be obtained.

For the convenience of laboratory preparation, we designed both NIP and PIN devices separately in this work. You can adjust the corresponding “experimental knowledge constraint” according to your own needs.

"Prob_params_all.csv" is the output file for the current example. "nip_manusccript" and "pin_manuscript" are the data we used when writing the manusccript.
