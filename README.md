# BO_Reverse_design

Bayesian reverse design based on experimental knowledge constraints.This work takes MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells as an example.

* In the Bayesian optimization process, the initial scatter points have a certain degree of randomness (which cannot be fixed by random seeds), so different optimal parameter values may be obtained.

* For the convenience of laboratory preparation, we designed both NIP and PIN devices separately in this work. You can adjust the corresponding “experimental knowledge constraint” according to your own needs.

* "Prob_params_all.csv" is the output file for the current example. "nip_manusccript" and "pin_manuscript" are the data we used when writing the manusccript.
